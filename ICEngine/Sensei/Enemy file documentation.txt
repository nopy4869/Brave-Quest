Enemy file:


6 types of data:
-Class Table [272] [16]
-Equation table [40] [8]
-Enemy table [256] [16]
-Character table [16] [16]
-Group table [256] [16]
-Item table [256] [16]

Anatomy of a Class string:
-First 9 bytes are used for the class name, the last byte being NUL, or '\0'
-The next 7 bytes are used for the equations governing the stats for the class in the following order

 -health from level			//HP												//Nothing
 -attack from level			//Physical Damage									//ability to do certain things or use certain equipment
 -defence from level		//Resistance to Physical Damage						//Nothing
 -wisdom from level			//Power of magical attacks							//Possibly lower store prices?
 -resistance from level		//Affects probability of getting poisoned etc.		//Possibly less effect for poisioning etc.
 -speed from level			//Affects Enemy accuracy and who hits first			//nothing
 -luck from level			//Affects own accuracy for everything & crits		//amount of loot from chests etc.

Anatomy of an equation:
 -8 numbers for an equation
 -  [0]x^7+[1]x^6+[2]x^5+[3]x^4+[4]x^3+[5]x^2+[6]x+[7]
 -Where [#] represents the number stored as byte number # of the equation in the table

Anatomy of an Enemy string:
-Bytes 0 - 12 are a nul terminated string, the Enemy's name
-Byte 13 is the letter displayed in battle for this enemy
-Byte 14 is the class of the enemy
-Byte 15 is the ai used by the enemy

Anatomy of a character string:
-Bytes 0 - 12 are a nul terminated string, the Character's default name
-Byte 13 is the letter displayed in battle for this Character
-Byte 14 is the Level by Experience number
-Byte 15 is the class number

Anatomy of a group:
-Bytes 0 - 11 are used to store the enemy number then the level offset in that order for each of the 6 different enemies.
-Byte 12 is used to store the loot group id number
-Bytes 13 - 15 are used to store the experience gained for beating this group

Anatomy of an item string:

-Bytes 0 - 11 are a nul terminated string, the item's name
-Byte 12 is the letter displayed for this item
-Byte 13 is the length of time (in seconds) this item lasts for
-Byte 14 is the attribute number
-Byte 15 is the amount to add (or subtract) from the named attribute

Notes:
-Classes can be used for both enemies and characters. Not only that, but since the enemies don't
 actually need to keep track of experience they don't need an Experience to Level equation.

-The game should generate a table saying the experience at each level for ease of coding the level-up
 routines.

-When the game calls the battle function with a group and a level (from which a random level close
 to the one specified is applied as the base level of the group as a whole ONLY IF THE LEVEL PASSED IS NEGATIVE!!!), the offsets are applied to the levels.

-For the items, if the time is 0 seconds, the affect is applied and not reversed. If the time is negative, then
 it gives its effect to the character holding it.

-It should be noted that if If implement saving of item effects, then saving the game before
 03:14:07 A.M. on January 19, 2038 and continuing after that date and time will allow players another
 hundred and thirty some years of the item's effect... unless the item effects are implimented as a 
 timer as opposed to an alarm.
 
-For attributes: The first  attributes are used for the person the item is being used on, the second  are for the whole party
