scripted AI
	very minimalistic
	used to simulate a person controlling the enemy AI
	
	Really more like a spell lookup table. I imagine using a sort of
	switch-case loop to select classes of attacks, then the particular
	attack


scripted spells
	Not as minimalist as AI, it can apply an effect, compare stats,
	change stats (Not permanent!!!!!)
	I imagine a group of commands, such as
		AddStat(stat number, integer)									A/a
		SubStat(stat number, integer)									S/s
		MultStat(stat number, float)									M/m
		DivStat(stat number, float factor)								D/d
		ChangeStat(stat number, integer)								C/c
		BranchStat(stat number, condition(l/e/g), line number)			b/u/B
		
		Capital Vs. Lower determines whether or not the integer/float is
			a random number				Cap for Rand, Low for nonrand
	Also includes metadata about the spell (animation, type of spell,
		relative strength, who it affects)
	
	Target's stats are mapped to the first 7 stats, caster's to the next 7,
		then everyone else on the field (including caster and target)


DO NOT FORGET TO ADD THE PACKER FUNCTIONS FROM SPELLER'S COMMONFUNCTIONS
	TO BRAVE QUEST!!!!!
