Brave-Quest
===========

Brave Quest is a console based role playing game written in c.
THIS IS NOT A TEXT BASED ADVENTURE GAME.
This game is nowhere near done yet, this page just serves to allow me
to keep track of the code across any computer I'm likely to run into
and code on. I will not host the actual game maps here
(at least not yet -.^), but I will have various test maps and all of
the game creation tools.


I apologise to the one person who was watching this project. I realized
today that I had accidentally uploaded a copy of the program Windhex to
the repository and had lost some data needed to delete stuff so I
reset the repository. The code now up reflects about 11 months worth of
changes, so at least you know I'm not dead :D


This game is still not ginger.
